# GenAI Data Workflow

## Overview
This project demonstrates how Generative AI can be integrated into a structured data workflow to generate insights from raw data.

## Problem Statement
How can Generative AI be used as a meaningful step in a data pipeline rather than as a standalone demo?

## Workflow
