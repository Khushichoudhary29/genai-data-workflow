# GenAI Data Workflow

## Overview
This project demonstrates how Generative AI can be integrated into a structured data workflow to generate insights from raw data.

## Problem Statement
How can Generative AI be used as a meaningful step in a data pipeline rather than as a standalone demo?

## Learning Notes
- Generative AI is most effective when used **after data preprocessing** to interpret results, not as a replacement for data handling.
- Treating GenAI as a **separate inference step** keeps the workflow modular and easier to extend.
- AI-assisted analysis can generate summaries and insights that help guide next steps in decision-making.
- Clear data flow and clean inputs are critical for meaningful GenAI outputs.

## Workflow
1. Ingest raw dataset
2. Clean and preprocess relevant text data
3. Send processed data to a Generative AI model
4. Generate summaries or insights
5. Save the output for further use


## Tech Stack
- Python
- Generative AI (API-based)
- Data Processing Libraries

## Project Status
In progress
